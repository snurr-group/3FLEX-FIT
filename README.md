# 3FLEX-FIT

3flex-fit is an automated transient uptake fitting tool in a Jupyter Notebook. This tool is associated with the following article authored by Florencia A. Son, Brandon C. Bukowski, Timur Islamoglu, Randall Q. Snurr, and Omar K. Farha. 
A link to the article in Chemistry of Materials can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c02462 

# Installation:
3Flex-Fit was written for Python 3.7.12 using Jupyter Notebooks (https://jupyter.org/). Our tool was designed using Jupyter to make it easier to see intermediate steps in the fitting process, promote transparency when other groups make modifications, and improve code readability. The code has been annotated and place in separate blocks to help diagnose issues.
Th Jupyter notebook can be downloaded directly from this repository and opened using Anaconda or Jupyter, using any operating system.
